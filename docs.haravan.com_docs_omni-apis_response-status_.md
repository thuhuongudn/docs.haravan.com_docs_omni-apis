# API response status and error codes

When receives a request to an API endpoint, a number of different HTTP status codes can be returned in the response depending on the original request.

| HTTP status | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 200 OK | The request was successfully processed by Haravan. |
| 400 Bad Request | The request wasn't understood by the server, generally due to bad syntax or because the `Content-Type` header wasn't correctly set to `application/json`. <br>This status is also returned when the request provides an invalid code parameter during the OAuth token exchange process. |
| 401 Unauthorized | The necessary `authentication credentials` are not present in the request or are incorrect. |
| 403 Forbidden | The server is refusing to respond to the request. This status is generally returned if you haven't `requested the appropriate scope` for this action. |
| 404 Not Found | The requested resource was not found but could be available again in the future. |
| 502 Bad Gateway | The server, while acting as a gateway or proxy, received an invalid response from the upstream server. A 502 error isn't typically something you can fix. It usually requires a fix on the web server or the proxies that you're trying to get access through. |
| 500 Internal ServerError | An internal error occurred in Haravan |
