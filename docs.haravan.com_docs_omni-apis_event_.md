# Events

`Version: 1.0`

Events are generated by specific haravan resources when specific things happen, such as the creation of an article, the placement or fulfillment of an order, the addition or deletion of a product, and so on. By requesting events, your app can get a "log" of important occurrences in the operation of a shop.

#### Caution [​](https://docs.haravan.com/docs/omni-apis/event/\#caution "Direct link to heading")

The events returned by the Events API should not be considered to be realtime. Events might not appear in the list returned by the API until a few seconds after they've occurred. In rare cases (<1% of the time) it can take up to a few minutes for some events to appear.
